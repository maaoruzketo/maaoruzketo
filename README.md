- 👋 Hi, I’m @maaoruzketo / Deon Simmons Jr.
- 👀 I’m interested in front end development and learning how to create projects for myself and others like a comic book reading app for example (it needs to be updated since the original api was taken down) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and a bit of AWS to further my hireability . I've dabbled in it before, but not enough to put it on my resume as a skill.
- 📫 How to reach me: I can be contacted at dsimmons@codestack.co. The email goes directly to my phone.
